        <p style="padding-left: 100px;">A couple of friends and I took a short one-day trip to Krakow, basically just to go early in the next morning to Auschwitz-Birknau. We 
            arrived in the afternoon, around 15h. Our first stop was the hostel we had booked and it was great, specially because we had a room just for ourselves.
            Then we went directly to the stunning Wawel Castle, perched majestically on a hill. The history and 
            architecture were captivating, and the view from the top was breathtaking.
            After the castle, we went to see the legendary Wawel Dragon 
            statue, because it was about to spit fire! It was a fun and we couldn't resist taking a few photos with it.

            <p style="padding-right: 220px;">
                Next, we headed to the Main Square, which was bustling with activity. 
                The colorful buildings and lively atmosphere made for a delightful stroll. 
                As evening fell, we found a cozy restaurant serving traditional Polish cuisine. 
                We indulged in pierogi, kielbasa, and other local dishes. The hearty food was 
                just what we needed to wrap up our whirlwind day in Krakow. It might have been 
                a short visit, but it was filled with history, culture, and good food. Krakow 
                left a lasting impression on all of us, and we promised to return for a longer stay next time.
